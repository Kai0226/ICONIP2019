Arts About us Story Archive Comments PolicyOf real estate; roses and living in the CBDBy SUZANNE VISSERWe left Alice Springs in 2009; after having lived here for more then a decade; because we wanted to buy a house and we were disgusted by the prices which had just gone up again; this time by 40%.I had just sold a business in Alice and decided to invest somewhere else. Erwin Chlanda wrote an article about our departure; it was accompanied by a photo of us in the Mall; suitcases ready.Alice; Love it; leave it the article was headed and it described how yet another business owner was leaving; taking her money out of Alice Springs. That business owner was me.What the photo did not show was my bleeding heart. Ive always loved Alice; and Alice had always been good to me. Yet I was going to betray her; because of her real estate prices and what you could get for them. I cried that whole first day of the road trip to NSW.To cut a long story short: were back since 2012. We lost the business that we bought and the house that we bought in NSW and everything else we owned. If I say drug Mafia; I probably do not have to explain more. If I say Nimbin you understand the whole story perhaps.What is important is that we chose to come back to Alice to find work after disaster had struck in NSW. Work in Alice Springs was; as usual; found in a wink. Now we needed a house.Buying was out of the question this time. I arrived in Alice in June 2012; six months before my husband; and lived in a share house until he joined me.The share house was in a Sadadeen street that was described to me on numerous occasions as a war zone. I decided to live in this war zone just to check out what it would be like.I had after all lived next to the river and opposite the salt bush for many years and had walked through it to take short cuts; also at night; only to be shouted at: Hey sis; nice boots! or Want a piece of chicken; sista?I had never locked the gates to my business; not even at night; and nothing was ever stolen except for an aluminium rose that was part of an art work. When I reported the stolen rose to the Alice Springs News ; Kieran Finnane wrote an article about it and a new rose appeared out of thin air!This was brought about by Mike Gillam in the Alice News of 23 October 2008.The case of the stolen roseSir; Re. letter to the editor pleading for the return of a stolen rose; one of three made from recycled aluminium cans by bulldozer driver; occasional sculptor and currently; law student at University of Adelaide; Simon Holding.To create this exquisite vase of roses Simon painstakingly deconstructed actual roses and replicated them in metal; petal by petal. The artwork was subsequently sold during an exhibition of sculptures at the silver bullet cafe in 2006.Simon was touched by the sentimental value placed on his work by local business woman; Suzanne Visser; and asked me to send her a replacement rose. He also offered to weld all three long stemmed roses and the vase to an appropriate counter; plinth or other heavy steel surface!To the person who stole the sculpture I would like to add: there is a big difference between taking a flower from a garden and stealing artwork and hopefully this difference will tarnish you in the eyes of the recipient.Mike GillamAlice SpringsAfter the story of the rose and my experience walking in the river and through the salt bush during my first time around in Alice I decided to ignore the war zone remarks and moved to Aneura Place in Sadadeen to wait for my husband to join me.I decided to never lock my car and leave things in it overnight: small items like a jumper; some change; a half full pack of cigarettes; a bottle of beer; a new towel.Not only did I never encounter anything that remotely resembled a war zone in that street; my car was never; not even once; opened. I checked this by sticking pieces of paper between the doors and the body of the car whenever I closed the unlocked doors.It was an experiment. It went on for six months. In the end I was almost hoping that something would happen; that someone would at least take that handful of gold coins that were there in plain view  but noone ever did.I decided to tell this war zone story to the Alice Springs News as soon as it would be appropriate to do so. That time has come now. That unlocked car is not in that street anymore; it is somewhere in the CBD.When the good old peaceful quiet share house days in Sadadeen were over and my husband and I were ready to rent a house together we decided it was going to be either out bush (Colonel Rose Drive and surroundings; Ilparpa; Ross Highway)  or the CBD. No suburbs for us this time.The CBD is not what you call hip; but we would make it hip by moving there; we told ourselves. And the bush; well the bush has been hip for years.The bush did not work out in time; there was nothing suitable available. So the CBD it was. People were listening with eyebrows raised to our plans to possibly rent in the middle of the CBD. What about the noise; the fighting; the screaming; the vomit; the pee and the poo? they asked.We shrugged. Maybe we were againembarking on something insane; but this time we had nothing to lose. So we did not listen to all well meant advice and warnings and moved to the CBD. That was three months ago.Were 0 minutes from Kmart; 0 minutes from Yippy and 0 minutes from Coles. We have range views. And you cannot imagine the peace and quiet. We love it!We hardly use the car. Woollies is our pantry and our freezer. Montys is around the corner. We walk to work. I have not encountered much noise; or screaming; vomit; pee or poo at all.Its a bit too quiet here in the evenings. If only everyone would come to the CBD we could create for ourselves a nice; convenient; cozy; hip town centre where businesses are open after 5pm and tourists like to dwell. Theres vacant land and buildings galore.The CBD is not dangerous; I go anywhere; on foot; at any hour of the night; yes also to the 24 hour shop. I cross the Melanka site. Alone. A woman. At night.And I dream of how nice it would be if people would live above all these shops; where now dark windows gape. If people would go out for a stroll and meet on the corners of the streets for a yarn. If there would be light behind these windows and shop fronts. If people would sit on their balconies watching the world go by.Imagine an Alice with a CBD like Venice; where one can hear footsteps on the pavement and music coming from little cafes. Why not? Why not in Alice? Weve got it all: the weather; the stars; the clean air; the international community; the empty buildings.All we need is people. And you dont even have to be brave. It is perfectly okay in the CBD.Photos: Suzanne and Mike  sad to leave; happy to be back.Be Sociable; Share!TweetPosted: June 1; 2013 at 3:33 pm   Post a comment8 Comments (starting with the most recent)NB: If you want to reply to a previous comment; start your comment with this notation: n where n is the number of the comment you want to reply to.VeronicaPosted January 4; 2015 at 7:17 pmWhat a lovely; inspiring story.View CommentRick EverettPosted July 28; 2013 at 9:24 amThanks for your insight Suzanne. I am currently contemplating a move from Newcastle NSW to Alice Springs; having been offered a new job there. I know little about the area and it is great to read positive stuff given that is a big move for our entire family. Perhaps I will bump into you in the new hip CBD. All the best Rick.View CommentSandyPosted June 5; 2013 at 9:47 amThanks for the uplifting story; Suzanne. You; Mike; Bob; all of you are right  Alice is a great town and I would like a dollar for all those who have left; only to return at a later date. One day the CBD will be filled with residential living and shops will be abuzz again. Sooner; rather than later; I hope.View CommentSuzanne VisserPosted June 2; 2013 at 10:35 amBob Durnan; Conventional negative doomsaying bullshit that is served up with monotonous regularity. Well said! Thats exactly the point I wanted to make. There is the occasional aggressive drunk here; yes. But compare that with a town like Byron Bay (we were close to this once beautiful coastal town); which has now become the most dangerous town of NSW. The fuel for aggression there is not grog but speed. In Byron Bay whole gangs go party crashing base ball bats in hand. Murder is a regular occurrence. Not to mention Nimbin; once the place to go and find peace and love. Semiorganised crime is everywhere in those beautiful hills and what is worse: the police there is useless. The police here are great. Compassionate but firm. And our social services; such as the YSOS; but also the Womens Shelter; DASA; CAAAPU; and the social workers at Centrelink; to name only a few; are second to none. Ive always thought that the spaces above shops in the CBD should be converted into living accommodation and I also think Alice Springs needs a stunningly built skyscraper by a upcoming killer architect; somewhere in the desert; to attract tourists and to solve the housing problem. Something with a museum on the ground floor and a restaurant on the top floor and a panorama like we once had by Hank Guth; and apartments with stunning desert views; some of the apartments lofts with only the bare minimum so that people can build them up at their own pace. If I were rich that would be a project I would embark on tomorrow. As for now I long to work again for one of these amazing organisations mentioned above.View CommentBob DurnanPosted June 1; 2013 at 9:48 pmThanks Susanne; great to hear from somebody who is prepared to look at the town with fresh eyes; and not fall for the conventional negative doomsaying bullshit that is served up with monotonous regularity in all manner of the towns forums. I (and several others who comment here) have written about similar experiences of the river and CBD at night over the last couple of years. If you know what you are doing; treat people with respect; dont overreact to the occasional angry drunk; and take a bit of care around any current known trouble spots; you are unlikely to strike any trouble in the CBD or riverbed areas during the evening or daytime. This applies especially over the last 15 months since the diligent work of the nighttime youth outreach workers (YSOS) has reduced antisocial behaviour by bored and alienated youth to a very low level; supported by excellent policing and daily followup by social workers who liaise with the youth and their families. If more shops were set up with accommodation included or converted to town houses; and more flats were built around the CBD (without going overboard in terms of height) I am sure that the CBD would be rejuvenated and provide a wonderful living environment.View CommentGini KesslerPosted June 1; 2013 at 8:52 pmSuzanne; your courage along with Mikes has truly inspired me. Having known you since the 90s in Tokyo; youve had to contend with so much adversity. Youll never know how much I admire you and all your accomplishments. Your giving; loving heart that has reached out to help only to get stepped on again and again; but you just keep being yourself and reaching out to others. You are one in a million in my book and Im proud to call you my friend! GiniView CommentSuzanne VisserPosted June 1; 2013 at 8:18 pmMike Gillam; Nice to hear you again! Thank you for your kind words. The word rose seems to still be current between us. This time in rose coloured glasses. Yes; our town can be dangerous at times; but where we decided to settle; on the East Coast; was a zillion times more dangerous. I think danger also depends on ones own attitude and hey; it is nice to write about something nice for a change. Not all is gloom and doom and theres much about our town that can and should be enjoyed. I saw it with fresh eyes when I came back and compared to many towns in Australia it is colourful; multicultural; a town of painters; and very very laid back. The friendliness of the people was also something I had almost forgotten in my two years of absence. Kind regards; Suzanne VisserView CommentMike GillamPosted June 1; 2013 at 6:11 pmSuzanne and Mike; Nice to hear youre back in town and Im sorry to hear of your experiences on the east coast. Many thanks for reminding us that stereotyping people; suburbs and places like Alice Springs denies the existence of a greater reality and sometimes treating people as trustworthy is a good starting point. And Im sure youre wise enough to know that youll be disappointed on occasion. Before someone pours scorn on you with a jibe about seeing the world through rose tinted glasses; may I suggest caution walking around the CBD at night. Unfortunately our town; like many places around the country; is not totally safe at night. Risk taking should be measured and the consequences of getting it wrong should always be considered first. That said; the CBD can only benefit from your presence and good will.View CommentPost a CommentYour email is never shared. Required fields are marked *Name*Email*WebsiteComment
What did we just watch?!You might be thinking exactly this after viewing this advertisement; that looks more like something that belongs on a porno website.The ad is acutally for a real estate listing for a Sydney property and since its release it has gone viral online because its extremely sexual undertones and pounding music legit reminds people of the intro to a bad porn video.Yep; all thats basically missing is a bomb chicka wah wah sound effect.The video is supposed to showcase a fourbedroom house for sale in south west Sydney but since it was posted on Realestate.com on Wednesday; people have become more focused on the people in the ad who are seen dancing seductively on a table.It was quickly shared around on Twitter and has received a roasting of spectacular fashion in the process.Some people called it so breathtakingly horrific that it borders on art and the most Real Estate Agent video I have ever seen.Others commented on the seemingly awkward layout of the house; especially the fact that the swimming pool runs right past the window of the ensuite bathroom.also for those in this thread asking if the toilet has full line of sight to the kitchen/dining room; the answer is unequivocally yes pic.twitter.com/401KvhPqZO  Nick Evershed (NickEvershed) April 17; 2019Never mind the video; the houses layout looks like it was a student project; said one person. Omg the swimmer can watch someone wee; another joked.The video has since been removed from the official listing on LJ Hookers website and from their youtube account.The real estate agent for the property; Sam Nader from LK Hooker Bankstown; has since come out in defence of the video; saying it was meant to be a spoof.I just wanted to do something different in the industry; and it really; really worked; he said.I did one for a hour in Illawong and it broke the record for the area. $3;205;000; sold before auction.Video gets attraction to the property; and the whole point of real estate is to get as many eyes as possible on the property. It was supposed to be funny. Whether its funny; its rude of its sexy; every video I do is different.LJ Hooker on the other hand released a statement apologising if the video offended anyone; saying they missed the mark.We understand that our recent video circulated on social media promoting one of our listing may have been taken out of context by some and for this we apologise; the statement read.We have removed the video from our digital and social media channels.At least everybodys talking about the property now!

They really wanted a good block in a nice residential area and the land is probably what sold it. I dont think they are going to fix the house  its probably too far gone. It is probably 1920sera and has the oldstyle roof where you look up at the corrugated iron; and just a single interior wall. Inside 52 Brodie St; Hughenden. Source:Supplied Ms Vohland said she was seeing more and more older people making the shift north; lured by the warmer climate and affordable housing. She said potential buyers from the more expensive southern capital cities were keen to unlock some equity and secure a house they could lock up and leave to go travel in their golden years. Thats good news for us; she said.The most recent Price Predictor Index report from Hotspotting by Ryder noted an improvement in Queensland regional areas damaged by trends in the resources sector. The number of regional Queensland locations classified as Danger markets has dropped from a record high of 31 late in 2016 to 19 now; the report found. The report tracks sales volumes rather than rises in the median house price to chart growth. Another property on Ms Vohlands books is 52 Brodie Street; also in Hughenden . The three bedroom cottage is on the market for $24;900 and sits on a 1012sq m block.

Another house at 38 Brodie St in Hughenden is on the market for $40;000. The latest property data from CoreLogic shows the median sales price in Hughenden is $95;000; up 18.8 per cent in the last 12 months. At its peak; Hughenden house prices reached $126;250 in 2012.

Both agents agreed there was plenty of reasons to make the move to the outback. Property data shows that many small mining towns are showing green shoots; with house prices in Clermont up 42.1 per cent in 12 months; reaching $270;000 after a peak of $350;000 in 2012. It is a similar story in Moranbah; where prices have risen 14.6 per cent in the past 12 months to $185;000 after falling from a high of $352;000 in 2007. In Blackwater; 60 houses have sold in the past 12 months with the median sales price now $105;000; which is still $45;000 less than the peak in 2014. Over 170 houses have sold in Emerald during the same period; with median sales prices up 12.1 per cent to $269;000 after a high of $455;000. CoreLogic senior research analyst Cameron Kusher said it would take a long time to get back up to the inflated prices seen during the mining boom. But he said many struggling mining towns were finally showing signs of growth. It is a slow and subtle rise. I doubt they will boom like they did but after a big decline we are seeing commodity prices lift and more demand for workers in some of these areas; he said. Mr Kusher said while values were down; many of the towns could still achieve decent rental yields  a positive for investors. Clearly there is some increasing demand from buyers and renters; he said. The cheapest housestyle accommodation in the Brisbane Greater Region is a one bedroom; one bathroom; relocatable home at Durack; which is on the market for $93;000. And in Sydney; even the most rundown fixerupper will set you back upwards of $1 million.

Property experts are calling the lowwater mark of Perths real estate market after 2017 saw the lowest number of dwelling sales in the metropolitan area in more than 25 years. Real Estate Institute of WA figures show just 26;223 sales of houses and units in Perth last year  the lowest number since 27;601 dwellings changed hands in 1990 during Paul Keatings recession we had to have. The figures show that while transactions have dropped significantly; prices have been more resilient since the resources boom ended in 2014; when the median Perth house price peaked at $555;000. In that time; median house prices have fallen to $515;000; while prices for units; which peaked at $450;000 in 2014; have fallen to $410;000. WA Treasurer Ben Wyatt acknowledged the challenges facing the housing market; with stamp duty collections down $60 million between last years Budget and the midyear review; and nearly $400 million down over five years. Stamp duty is one of the State Governments biggest tax sources; worth an estimated $1.43 billion this financial year. Video They may be cheap for Perth real estate; but there is a catch... they are on a 80 square metre block. Underlying duty; largely generated from the residential property market; increased in the March quarter 2018 compared to the previous year; the first such quarterly year on year increase since the September quarter 2014; Mr Wyatt said. The softness of the housing market is not new; but I have learnt from the many Real Estate advocates that I have come across that this does translate to the fact that now is a great time to buy! REIWA State president Hayden Groves described last years sales figures as extraordinary and perplexing; particularly given the number of dwellings in Perth had doubled since 1990. Mr Groves property owners had gone into their shells and stopped trading in real estate as the state was hit with outbound migration prompted by the end to the mining boom. However; he said the reaction had been out of proportion to the underlying strength of the WA economy; which he noted was far bigger now than 30 years ago. According to Mr Groves; strong activity in aspirational suburbs with median house prices above $750;000; such as Wembley and Applecross; indicated the market was turning as buyers sought to capitalise on relative bargains. He said trading in the first three months of the year had already been brighter than in the past few corresponding periods and predicted prices would nudge up 23 per cent this year before accelerating from 2020. 2017 was the lowwater market of housing transactions for the last 30odd years in Perth; Mr Groves said. Prices actually have held up in Perth surprisingly well given some of those points. Where theres growth its all been in those aspirational; higher priced; higher value suburbs. Thats a community thats saying right; the bottom of the market has arrived; we can now afford to buy in Cottesloe or Applecross and lets do it because were not going to see them this cheap ever again. It will be a much calmer market but it will slowly build from here. From 2020 were probably starting to see plus five per cent to 10 per cent growth per annum... because Perth is still comparatively cheap compared with the Sydney and Melbourne markets.

The national median house price fell 1.0 per cent over the June quarter and year; according to a report by property classifieds group Domain released on Thursday. It is the first time values have fallen on an annual basis since June 2012. The negative national growth rate reflects weakening house prices in Sydney and Melbourne; which together represent about two thirds of Australias housing market by value. Sydney house prices fell by 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to the end of June for their largest annual drop since 2008. Sydney units also fell by 3.5 per cent over the same period. The figures chime with those released this week by property data firm CoreLogic; which said overall Sydney prices fell 5.0 per cent in the 12 months to July 22. House and unit prices in Sydney are now back to values seen at the end of 2016; Domain property analyst Nicola Powell told AAP. Tighter credit availability and a high number of units being built are key factors behind the dive; Dr Powell said. With more choice and less urgency; there are fewer active buyers in the market; and those who are in the market are being restricted by tightening lending standards and the availability of credit. Lending standards have come under fire at the ongoing banking royal commission; leading many institutions to increase scrutiny of borrowers income and expenses  particularly in Sydney and Melbourne; which have high home price to income ratios. Hobart; meanwhile; delivered the strongest annual house price growth of all capital cities at 15.9 per cent; continuing its trend of doubledigit annual growth that started in early 2017. Were seeing a lot of capital from Melbourne and Sydney flow into Hobart  as it offers relative affordability; Dr Powell said.

"Household Comfort report finds proportion of Australians feeling financially secure has risen Vast majority surveyed believe house prices won't keep falling Income increases not felt across the board; casual workers report wage lossesThat's the key finding of ME Bank's latest financial comfort"" report; which surveyed 1;500 people about how they perceived their own finances in the second half of 2018. The 15th biannual report found income gains; easing living costs and increased savings were key drivers in households' feeling more comfortable. ""Most households are well supported by both [subdued] wage gains and stronger jobs growth  albeit underemployment remains high;"" the report reads. House prices have fallen dramatically in some parts of the country lately; with drops of nearly 10 per cent felt in Sydney and Melbourne over the past year alone. And the fall appears to be picking up speed in the new year ; dropping an average of 1 per cent last month nationally. Despite this; the vast majority of residential property owners surveyed by ME Bank were bullish about their own fortunes. Only 13 per cent of homeowners and 11 per cent of investors expected the value of their properties to fall this year.External Link What do you think will happen to house prices over the next 12 months?Economist and report coauthor Jeff Oughton said the recent ""correction"" in house prices had been felt most keenly at the top end of the market. ""We've seen a correction for wealthier; older propertyowning Australians who've been riding the hot property and bull share markets for much of the past seven years;"" he said. ""Middle and lowerincome households have begun to benefit from an easing in living cost pressures and income gains.Property outlook for 2019Policymakers have embarked on the delicate task of deflating a property bubble without bursting it  this year we'll find out if they've succeeded.""Together the changes have helped bridge the gap in financial inequality that had been widening."" More broadly; the report found the gap in financial comfort between high and averageincome households had also closed. It found the financial comfort of those earning more than $200;000 a year fell by 6 per cent to 6.79 out of 10; while those earning $75;000 to $100;000 reported their financial comfort had increased by 7 per cent to 5.87. The overall index across all wages rose by 2 per cent to 5.56 out of 10  higher than any of the past five surveys. Not an even spread Despite the average rise in financial comfort; an increase in household income was not felt across the board. The report found fulltime workers were the most likely to report an income boost over the last year; followed by the selfemployed; while casual employees reported the highest level of income reduction.External Link Income changes over the past yearAustralians are also tightening their belts and saving more; suggesting a level of anxiety about the state of the economy. Mr Oughton said a number of factors could explain this caution. ""We're still seeing some geopolitical effects; with households concerned about the world economy up two points to 29 per cent;"" he said. ""Combined with domestic property and share market corrections; many Australians are beginning to tighten their belts to build financial resiliency. ""If aboveaverage cash savings and reduced spending behaviour continues during 2019 it could significantly slow economic growth and in turn may lead to smaller job and income gains.""Posted Thu 7 Feb 2019; 8:54 AM AEDTShareEmailFacebookTwitterRelatedHouseholds at 'tipping point'; as more Aussies struggle to pay living costsCould financial plain packaging break Australia's debt addiction?Rate cuts as likely as rises as Reserve Bank governor eyes falling house pricesMore Stories'I get new ones every day': NRL sex tapes are spreading in WhatsApp groupsOutback KFC announces early closures to protect staff after becoming default safe houseSuitcase murder suspect's family were on lookout for potential bridesPolice interviewed dead dentist's exboyfriend before he died in car crash'It's been pretty wild': From bushfires to snow all in one week at Mount Baw BawAnalysis: Camry in a coal mine  are slumping car sales warning us the economy's about to crash?Kerr strikes again as Matildas win Cup of Nations with victory over ArgentinaNASA's Mars InSight lander stuck between a rock and a hard placeAnalysis: There's an important thread missing from the abortion conversationMassive python bites off more than it can chewMore from ABC NewsHomeJust InPoliticsWorldAnalysis  OpinionBusinessSportScienceHealthArtsLive StreamsVideoPhotosEntertainmentUploadSubscribeRuralOther TopicsTop of pageChange to standard viewABC NewsJust InWorldBusinessHealthEntertainmentSportAnalysis  OpinionWeatherTopicsArchiveCorrections  ClarificationsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibilityContact the ABC 2019 ABC"""

I don't mind being a renter; except for this one thingDoesnt matter the dwelling; my real estate agents have always been hopeless  and utterly unapologetic about their incompetence. (Getty Images/Digital Vision)PreviousNextShow GridPreviousNextHide GridImage1 /VideoAudioIve heard the jokes about lawyers; and usedcar salesmen. I know what people think of taxidermists. But; seriously; what is it with real estate agents?ByMatilda DixonSmith22 Feb 2018  11:30 AM  UPDATED22Feb201811:32AMTweetOPINIONIf the doomsdayers are to be believed; the property market in this country is so deeply broken that millennials like me will be renting for the rest of our living days. And; as much as the Property Brothers ; Selling Houses Australia loving side of me is disappointed by my diminishing prospects of home ownership; I actually dont mind being a renter.Well; except for one thing: the frustrating close proximity it places me to rental real estate agents.Truly; there is no one on this earth more detestable than a rental real estate agent. Ive heard the jokes about lawyers; and usedcar salesmen. I know what people think of taxidermists. And; yes; I do have a longstanding feud with every employee of the Australian postal service. (Look; Australia Post; if you dont like parcels clogging up the storage areas of your post shops; you should probably stay open outside of business hours .)But real estate agents who manage rental properties are in their own special category.Good morning to everyone except real estate agents  Chloe Papas  (chloepapas) February 15; 2018Not only are they difficult to deal with; incompetent; uncaring and suspiciously untruthful; they appear to delight in being all of the above. And I have the receipts to prove it.Ive been a renter in Melbourne for almost a decade; and boy; have I collected a cavalcade of absurd tales of woe regarding my interactions with real estate agents. East of the city; west of the city; in apartments; houses; shitty units above shops and decadent concrete abodes designed for people far better off than me.Doesnt matter the dwelling; my real estate agents have always been hopeless  and utterly unapologetic about their incompetence.There was the house in Brunswick without a letter box; which took so long to be fixed the post office threatened to stop delivering our mail until the situation was resolved.Doesnt matter the dwelling; my real estate agents have always been hopeless  and utterly unapologetic about their incompetence.Or; how about the hole in the floor of our unit; which was right in front of a doorway; meaning we had to leap over the hole like acrobats to get from one room to the next? That one took nine months to be fixed; after a stern communique from the Victorian Tenants Union; we lived next door to our real estate agents office.Ive lived in houses with falling down garage doors  exposing the whole back of our largewindowed house to anyone who wandered down the street  and leaks in the ceiling so bad the whole level flooded every time it rained (in Melbourne thats like once a week during winter).And; each time; the real estate agents were suspiciously unable to help. Or they forget to call you back about the work order. Or they just cant seem to get onto the landlord. Or they made a slight miscalculation with the rental payment for this month.And what are we to do; us terminal renters? Where else can we go for our property needs; but to these suspiciously unavailable; unhelpful; sharpsuited; whitetoothed devils?Nowhere; unfortunately  because its nearly impossible to rent property in Australia without the help of a real estate agent. And in all these years; throughout all these myriad properties; Ive never met a good one.Sure; it sounds like a pretty big generalisation; right? But Ill ask you right now to close your eyes. Go on; close them. Now: think back. Back to all the rental properties youve occupied in the past. Yes; even that one (I know it was awful).Look deep; deep inside yourself; and admit youve never met a good real estate agent either.AdvertisementIn SocialIn SocialSubscribeFacebook62 KFollowTwitterTrending TopicsWhat we get wrong about smart Asian kidsWatch Troye Sivan read wildly inappropriate thirst tweets about himselfWatch these brides set their dresses on fire for the ultimate wedding photoI don't mind being a renter; except for this one thingThe women who dont know theyre autisticTrending SBSExclusive: Fatherofseven with Australian passport to be deportedImams; Muslim groups outraged by PMs 'divisive' Bourke Street commentsHungry Jacks Premier League Masters WidgetNo takers for thousands of Australian permanent residency visasWoman faces court over alleged strawberry needle contaminationAdvertisementBack to topCopyrightTerms  ConditionsPrivacyDisclaimerYour online preferencesAudience Technical SupportComplaintsContactMedia ReleasesThe SBS CharterCodes of PracticePolicies  PublicationsFreedom of InformationPublic Interest DisclosureSenate Order  Entity ContractsFreeviewUsing this WebsiteFAQsOur StoryCommissioned ContentTranslations  SubtitlingSales  AdvertisingTenders  Purchasing OpportunitiesPublicity Media CentreCareersHow to receive SBS TV  RadioHow to get my Program on SBSWhat SBS tells me about AustraliaWhy SBS introduced commercialsThe SBS Board of DirectorsNITVPodcastsCQ Cultural IntelligenceNewslettersx
Topics NT News Lifestyle Darwins northern suburbs are proving attractive options to buy in; as they lead the property market to its rebound. Nightcliff resident Lee LevettOlsen said the current state of the market gave him confidence he would sell his house for a fair price. The markets been flat for a long time but it does seem to be picking up here; he said. What Id say is the market is still low enough that somebody is going to make a very good deal. He said the northern suburbs gave him an enjoyable lifestyle that he would look to continue in his retirement. When we came up from South Australia it was the tropics that attracted us; and the place were living in just typifies the tropics; he said. The small swimming pool is like a billabong with plants all around the property; its got louvres everywhere so the breezes just go through and for us its a big plus that its in Nightcliff  it holds a wonderfully mixed community. Were about a fiveminute walk from the foreshore and the jetty; and that track for bicycles is just wonderful. We like the local mix of shops and there are good restaurants. Raine and Horne general manager Glenn Grantham said the northern suburbs provided a great location for many different types of people and was gaining interest. Quality; welllocated and wellpresented properties in northern suburbs such as Nightcliff; Leanyer and Tiwi are achieving strong inquiry with as many as 12 groups attending Saturday open for inspections; he said. In the northern suburbs; were almost back to the good old days of four years ago. Mr Grantham said he only expects the market to grow in the coming months. By June or July next year; I expect that we will see more even Darwin property market activity with the numbers of properties for sale level pegging with buyer demand; he noted. It will neither be a buyers or sellers market  at this point; we will also see more demand for properties across the entirety of Darwin and Palmerston. 
"AEDTPhotoAustralian house prices may be 4pc down from their peak; but they are still up more than 40pc over the decade.Maximillian Conacher: public domainIt's a busy week for the Reserve Bank. There's the annual Cup Day board meeting and the release of its latest batch of forecasts in the quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy on Friday. Busy is a relative term. Nothing much will change. Interest rates will stay on hold at the record low of 1.5 per cent; as they have at every meeting since August 2016. The key forecasts for GDP growth; inflation and unemployment over the foreseeable horizon will remain largely untouched. The glass will remain halffull at the RBA's Martin Place HQ. While a batch of data released last week may not alter the RBA's view; it was unsettling nonetheless. That core inflation missed the RBA's target is almost a given these days. It's undershot every quarter for almost three years now. But perhaps the more subtle worry is falling house prices feeding into retail sales and ultimately consumption. Friday's retail sales figures were undeniably poor. Growth is now almost negligible; up just 0.2 per cent in the September quarter. The hardesthit sectors were in discretionary spending; particularly household goods.External Link Retail sales by sectorClearance rates point to a crash: analyst This weekend's property auction results were again pretty bleak for the sellers; but good for the few buyers who turned up. Sydney's preliminary clearance rate was 44 per cent compared to 60 per cent a year ago. In Melbourne only around 42 per cent of properties sold; compared to 67 per cent a year ago.External Link Christopher tweetIn Brisbane fewer than a third of properties up for auction sold. Louis Christopher; head of property researcher SQM; said results like that translate into price falls of up to 3 per cent a quarter and put the market on a crash"" trajectory. ""There were nearly as many properties withdrawn in Sydney as reported sold;"" he said. ""170 withdrawn versus 222 sold. I've never seen a ratio that high."" Falling house prices hitting consumers Perhaps it is a coincidence; but the lower end of the property market finally started falling around the time retail sales hit the brakes. While top end property prices started falling a bit over a year ago; the less volatile bottom quartile of the market held out until the end of June. So far; the impacts of expensive housing keeling over have been barely noticeable in the broader economy.External Link Oliver tweetGDP was strong and consumer spending OK over the second quarter; despite real income per worker falling. However; price falls in the property market are far broader now. The bottom end of the market is down around 2 per cent over the year; compared to the almost 10 per cent fall in the top end. The affordable end of the market becoming more affordable is terrific news for first home buyers; but it makes existing home owners  already worried about stagnant wages and falling savings  more anxious about their dwindling wealth. In that environment; consumer spending becomes a bigger worry. ""The price of less expensive housing tends to be less volatile; and price falls much rarer  declines in this segment suggest more persistent weakness in the property market;"" Morgan Stanley's Daniel Blake said. ""Additionally; spending of owners of housing in this segment are likely to be more sensitive to prices; given that lower income households tend to hold less savings buffers. ""This suggests we may begin to see signs of wealth effects from housing in the latter half of the year.""External Link Joiner tweetHas the economy already peaked? September's weak retail figures may just be the start of that. The economic bedrock of the first half of the year  household consumption and residential construction  could start to look rather shaky. ""We think household consumption moves to a sub2 per cent annual pace next year with housing turning into a drag on activity;"" RBC's SuLin Ong observed after the dust settled on last week's house price and retail data. Ms Ong said Australian economic growth may have peaked for the time being. Just how persistent and broad the house price fall will be is open to question. However; the annualised rate  viewed over a three month period; which flattens out some monthly volatility  seems to show the rate of decline slowing in both the top and more affordable ends of the market up to the end of October.PhotoExternal Link House prices: top quartile vs bottom quartileThe slight uptick in the three months to November shouldn't be construed as an effort to call the bottom of the market; but as the graph shows; things can turn around fairly quickly. Either end of the market is affected by different forces to a degree. The topend has been hit by tighter credit and the regulatory squeeze on interestonly loans and investors. Bottomend will; to an extent; be squashed by the vast supply flowing through the residential construction pipeline in the next 12 to 18 months. That said; strong employment growth is likely to continue to put a floor under the price of more affordable end of the market for some time yet. So has home affordability improved? Just how grim is the property price slide? It depends on your perspective. Those looking to get into the market will be cheering falling prices. Across the national capitals; the CoreLogic Home Value Index is back to where it was in January 2017. So if you bought a property since then; chances are you are underwater and unhappy. National dwelling values are 3.5 per cent below where they were a year ago at their peak. While Sydney and Melbourne have experienced sharper falls than the national average; the declines are still modest and fairly insubstantial compared to gains made by those who've been in the market for several years. Perth is a different world of pain. CoreLogic's reading of the market there is property is worth less than it was a decade ago. Ouch. ""While home owners don't like to see the value of their assets falling; to put this into perspective; values are still 45 per cent higher over the past decade and 210 per cent higher over the past 20 years;"" CoreLogic's Cameron Kusher said. Market 1 years 10 years 20 years Sydney 7.4pc +81.4pc +220.1pc Melbourne 4.9pc +74.7pc +295.4pc Brisbane 0.3pc +16.1pc +185.3pc Adelaide +1.8pc +23.7pc +198.6pc Perth 3.3pc 1.1pc +159.0pc Hobart +9.7pc +42.9pc +230.0pc Darwin 2.9pc 3.1pc +77.8pc Canberra +4.3pc +35.4pc +233.6pc Source: CoreLogic ""Although values in Sydney and Melbourne are seeing accelerating rates of decline; in the context of the runup in values over recent years; it has not greatly improved affordability;"" Mr Kusher said. If you couldn't afford to get in a few years ago; you probably can't afford to now. ""CoreLogic expects values to continue declining over the coming months; however it is unlikely that these falls will make any significant improvement to affordability; especially in the absence of real income growth."" In other words; most markets would need many more years of price declines to generate the sort of affordability now seen in Perth and Darwin. Wall St slips again on trade worries After a pretty torrid October; global markets kicked off a new month feeling a bit more chipper. Over the week the ASX was up more than 3 per cent. US gains were a bit more modest; but still a handy 2.4 per cent; while the Asian market was the standout. Japan jumped 5 per cent and China rose nearly 4 per cent as the authorities there again intervened to calm the jitters. However; global politics' latest game show ""Deal Or No Deal""; featuring US and Chinese Presidents Trump and Xi; was a ratings flop on Wall Street. On Friday; it overshadowed otherwise positive economic news with another strong month of jobs creation and annual wage growth pushing above 3 per cent for the first time in almost a decade. The dimming chances of an imminent trade deal saw all indices slip; with the NASDAQ faring the worst thanks to Apple tumbling almost 7 per cent on weak earnings guidance. Not great news for the ASX; but judging by futures trading; not disastrous either.Markets on Friday's close: ASX SPI 200 futures 0.1pc at 5;811 ASX 200 (Friday's close) +0.1pc at 5;811 AUD: 72.0 US cents; 63.2 euro cents; 55.5 British pence; 81.5 Japanese yen; $NZ1.08 US: Dow Jones 0.4pc at 25;271 SP500 0.6pc at 2;723 NASDAQ 1.0pc at 7;094 Europe: FTSE 0.3pc at 7;094 DAX +0.4pc at 11;519 EuroStoxx50 +0.3pc at 3;214 Commodities: Brent oil 0.8pc at $US72.59/barrel; Gold flat at $US1232/ounce; Iron ore $US75.40/tonneThere was a bit more action on commodities markets. Oil was down 7 per cent over the week. Friday's trade saw it slip almost 1 per cent to be around 15 per cent lower than a month ago. While the US followed through with threats to impose sanctions on Iran; there were big carveouts allowing the likes of India; South Korea; Japan and five other nations to keep buying oil from the pariah nation. Tehran's reaction seemed to be along the lines of ""whatever"". Iron ore was in a holding pattern after losing ground in recent weeks and copper gained. RBA rates and forecasts on hold Locally this week the RBA is the main game; apart from a horse race. Unlike the Melbourne Cup; the RBA on Tuesday is a onehorse race  No Change will salute again. You can place a ""multi"" on the US Federal Reserve to hold as well on Wednesday; but that won't pay much either. Of more significance will be the RBA's forecasts contained in the quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy. As ANZ's economics team points out; ""Critically; the forecasts in this SoMP will establish the jumpingoff point for the forecasts into 2021"". ANZ's house view is the RBA will leave its forecasts on inflation and economic growth relatively untouched and nudge down its trajectory for the unemployment rate. However; while unemployment is improving; ANZ believes the RBA will be more cautious in its outlook on wages. Given the RBA's forecasts have rather overestimated wages growth for years; caution is understandable. Others might just give up guessing.Photo Not even close. The RBA has maintained overly optimistic forecasts for wages growth for yearsSupplied RBAWestpac wraps up bank reporting season Locally there is a fair bit on the corporate calendar. Westpac drops its full year results on Monday. Underlying cash profit  excluding onoffs  should be fairly flat at around $8 billion.

"AESTPhotoA graph showing house pricetoincome ratios around the worldIMFThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has found Australia has the third highest house pricetoincome ratio in the world. The IMF's Global Housing Watch says global house prices have risen consistently for nearly the past two years. The fund says prices are well above the historical averages"" in developed countries including Belgium; Canada; Australia; Norway and Sweden. In addition; the IMF found 14 out of 24 developed economies examined still have aboveaverage house pricetoincome ratios; even after the dent in home values in many countries caused by the global financial crisis. While a recovery in housing markets around the world is welcome; the IMF says it is critical to avoid another unsustainable boom in house prices like the one that preceded the GFC. ""In fact; our research indicates that boombust patterns in house prices preceded more than twothirds of the recent 50 systemic banking crises;"" IMF deputy managing director Min Zhu said in a blog post .Property prices out of whackStruggling to buy a house? It could be because our property prices are among the highest in the world when compared to incomes; writes Michael Janda.However; Dr Zhu also noted that historically high housing prices do not automatically portend a crash. ""In some cases; this more detailed look suggests much more modest overvaluation than indicated by the house pricetoincome and house pricetorent ratios;"" Dr Zhu wrote. The IMF is quick to add that this does not mean policymakers can be complacent. It is urging regulators; like the Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority; to move from ""benign neglect"" and take a range of steps to contain housing booms. ""Housing is an essential sector of every countrys economy and has systemic implications; which is why we at the IMF are focusing on it not only in individual countries but on a crosscountry basis;"" Dr Zhu wrote. ""What is clear ... is that monetary policy will need to be more concerned than it was before with financial stability and hence with housing markets."" Martin North from Australian banking research outfit Digital Finance Analytics says there are several measures that could be taken. ""We need to think about whether the current capital rules are appropriate for commercial lending versus owner occupied and investment lending;"" he said. ""Are there also opportunities to bring in additional controls; for example; to limit high loantovaluation lending; the ratio between income and house prices; to begin to take some of the heat out of the market.""Read the IMF's research herePosted Thu 12 Jun 2014; 7:57 AM """
How to buy your first home 1:21 After all the hard work of saving that deposit; you've still got quite a journey to go on before owning your first home. Here's what you need to do to finally buy it. June 29th 2018 7 months ago /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Lifestyle  syndicated/Adelaides resilient property market continues to defy a weakening trend on the east coast; with the leafy Adelaide Hills attracting most attention from buyers. New figures from realestate.com.au rank three Adelaide Hills suburbs  Aldgate; Crafers West and Belair  in the top ten indemand suburbs nationally. The figures are based on the number of views per listing on the real estate website in the December quarter; with the three Hills suburbs each attracting between 5200 and 5800 views per listing. Australia's most in demand suburbs. Source:Supplied Ouwens Casserly real estate agent Dale Gray; who specialises in the Adelaide Hills; said families continued to be the dominant buyer group; but downsizers and buyers relocating from the east coast had also become more active. Weve noticed certainly towards the end of last year and beginning of this year the market has been a lot more buoyant; she said. We had a couple of properties transact in Crafers just before Christmas and there was an absolute bevy of buyers interested in those properties. With new distilleries; wineries and world class restaurants all on your doorstep; theres a lot more on offer up here. Media house prices provided by realestate.com.au. Source:Supplied Realestate.com.au chief economist Nerida Conisbee said demand for Adelaide Hills property reflected stronger conditions across the city. She said it was partly investorled; with high volumes of searches from Sydney and Melbourne. Adelaide is defying the odds; she said. The citys median has hit the highest level recorded and there is no region experiencing declines. Both premium and affordable suburbs are attracting buyers; with Adelaides first $2 million suburb; Medindie; recording the fastest price growth in Australia last year; while the median price in Gawler West jumped 35 per cent to more than $300;000. While Adelaides property market continues to bubble along; the story is much different in Sydney  where prices fell 5.9 per cent last year  and Melbourne; where the median price dropped 1.5 per cent. However; Ms Conisbee said fears that tighter lending conditions and the abolishment of negative gearing would cause a market crash were overplayed. Were not seeing the big jumps in listings that are typical of a price crash; she said. AROUND THE COUNTRY ANALYSIS FROM REALESTATE.COM.AU ADELAIDE Adelaides bucking the downturntrend with the citys medium hitting the highest level recorded while no region recorded a decline. Adelaide premium suburbs have grown with Medindie becoming the citys first $2 million median suburb; but so have some of the cheapest suburbs. Gawler West jumped 35 per cent over 2018; hitting a high of just over $300;000; while one of the citys cheapest suburbs; Elizabeth; rose 7 per cent. SYDNEY Although Sydney retains the highest priced suburbs  with a $955;000 median house price  many are falling greater than anywhere else in Australia; with middle priced suburbs suffering the most and expensive suburbs holding up well. Manly and Paddington are now some of the highest views per listing in NSW and are also clocking moderate price growth. Prices have fallen 6.7 per cent in Sydney from the peak and there is the potential for another 5 per cent fall in the first half of the year. MELBOURNE Melbournes performance is certainly a lot stronger than Sydney and while its been hit by the same finance restrictions; the Victorian capital seems to be supported by jobs growth. It will take some time to get a clear read on what is happening with jobs; but the demand from renters in the city suggests jobs are being created and people are continuing to move to Melbourne. The west is recorded the strongest growth; up 1.8 per cent yearonyear. Despite Melbournes overall softening; regional Victoria is booming with Ballarat; Geelong and LaTrobeGippsland performing well. BRISBANE Innercity Brisbane is defying the countrys downturn with prices up 2.2 per cent while some suburbs in Gold Coast are doing particularly well  Main Beach rose almost 30 per cent yearonyear and Currumbin is up more than 13 per cent. Large volumes of search activity on realestate.com.au from Sydney suggests these price increases may be driven in part by Sydney money. CANBERRA Canberra is currently the second strongest market in Australia and will benefit from a change of prime minister as Labor Governments tend to employ more staff. There will also be a high need for consultants in the early stages of transition. With price growth at 1.35 per cent over the past 12 months; its unlikely these flat conditions will turn negative in the first half of 2019. HOBART Two of the most in demand suburbs in Australia are in Hobart  Battery Point and South Hobart  and Carlton is moving quickly up the most popular list. 2017s quickest moving suburb; Margate; rose more than 18 per cent in 2018; double that for Hobart which suggests Carlton will outperform the market. The city recorded its first $1 million suburb with Battery Point hitting $1.34 million. Hobarts price growth is expected to continue this year. PERTH The stopstart nature of Perths recovery appears to have stalled or declined; but suburbs within the city continue to perform strongly. Peppermint Grove; one of Australias most expensive suburbs; is still recording increases and West Perth rose almost 27 per cent. The most in demand suburbs continue to show a mix of beachside (Cottesloe and City Beach); as well as inner West suburbs (Shenton Park). DARWIN Like Perth; any recovery in Darwin is stopstart and was completely derailed by the royal commission; any improvements to financing will be a positive for this market. While prices continue to fall; premium property is holding up. Fannie Bay is Darwins most expensive suburb and continues to record very high views per listing and double digit price growth. Parap; a slightly cheaper suburb than Fannie Bay; rose 7 per cent. Continue the conversation James_P_Hall | james.hall1news.com.au 
"Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The median house in Perth has lost nearly $100;000 in value in the past five years; with suburbs in Mandurah and the eastern fringes hit the hardest by the drop; according to new figures. CoreLogic's March home value index report; released Monday; showed Perth had gone from being Australia's most expensive city to live in in 2006; to one of the cheapest in 2019. Perth property values have dropped; on average; by $100;000 in the past five years. Credit: Arsineh Houspian The housing price plummet has allowed more first homebuyers to enter the market; but for sellers it has seen the value of the average Perth dwelling drop from $540;556 in 2014 to $442;716 in March 2019. The downward trend is losing some of its steam; but CoreLogic predicts the 'bottomingout' of the housing market is yet to come. Advertisement According to the report; Perth property values have dropped by 17.4 per cent in the past five years; by 7.7 per cent in the past year; 2.9 per cent in the past quarter; and by 0.4 per cent in the past month. CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless said areas in Perth's urban fringes had been hardest hit by the price drop. Because it is a very affordable market now; we aren't really seeing that demand towards the medium to lower ends of the markets;"" he said. ""There are signs WA's housing supply is now fairly in tune with demand and as a result rents are rising and housing is very affordable; we just need that magical ingredient of credit availability as well as stronger economic conditions to really unlock the marketplace."" Banks tightened the rules around lending in mid2018 after it was revealed they frequently loaned homebuyers more than 40 per cent of their disposable income. The changes mean it's harder for buyers to get access to credit. Mr Lawless said Perth's property market peaked in 2014 during the mining boom before beginning to decline on the back of softer commodity prices and an economic downturn. ""From there we've started to see unemployment rising; jobs growth falling and migration rates moving into the negative  that is still somewhat the case; although it's not quite as severe as it used to be;"" he said. REIWA president Damian Collins said despite the CoreLogic index showing a decline in Perth dwelling values; there were many suburbs that had improved in the month to March. ""While dwelling values declined again in March; the rate of decline has slowed to the lowest level recorded since June 2018; which is a positive indication that prices in Perth may be approaching the bottom;"" he said. ""REIWA data shows there were numerous suburbs that saw their median house price buck the declining trends; with 30 per cent of those statistically significant suburbs experiencing an increase in price and 15 per cent remaining stable; which is a positive trend in the current real estate environment. The 10 bestperforming suburbs for median house price growth in March were Mullaloo; Wannanup; Lesmurdie; Alkimos; Karrinyup; Yanchep; Rivervale; Mount Pleasant; The Vines and Warnbro. In regional WA; mining towns in the west Pilbara are beginning to recover from the pits of the mining bust; with housing values up 9.8 per cent on the past year; according to CoreLogic. However the value is still 58 per cent down from its peak in 2012; when humble country homes were being sold for sevenfigure sums as mining companies scrambled to house their employees. REIWA statistics show the Karratha suburbs of Bulgarra; Millars Well and Pegs Creek were the top three highest growth suburbs in WA in 2018. Nationally; property values continued to decline to March; with Sydney and Melbourne's markets taking the biggest hit in the past 12 months; losing 10.8 per cent and 9.8 per cent value respectively. Hobart; Canberra and Adelaide bucked the national trend; each recording an increase in property values. Hobart experienced the highest level of growth; at six per cent; which Mr Lawless said was due to more eastern states residents seeking a treechange; or lifestyle property at an affordable price.

"As Master of the Royal Mint; he helped reform England's currency; the pound sterling; clamped down on counterfeiting and; in 1717; accidentally moved Britain to its first ever gold standard. His record as an investor; however; wasn't quite so illustrious. Newton lost a fortune  around 20;000 pounds  in one of history's most notorious market collapses; the South Sea Bubble; when the South Sea Company; primarily a slave trader; collapsed in 1720. If only he'd remembered his early work as a physicist and applied his revolutionary theories on gravity to markets. In an eerie parallel; Australian real estate; particularly in Sydney and Melbourne; now appears to be succumbing to Newton's third law; that for every action; there is an equal and opposite reaction. What goes up; must come down.Infographic: National housing prices continue to decline. (Supplied)Last week; Sydney's property market experienced its 12th straight month of declines while falls in Melbourne accelerated; sparked a flurry of warnings of impending doom. The question now is: will the housing bubble deflate or burst? The good Aussie real estate has endured prolonged periods of decline before. The two most severe; in the early 1890s and the 1930s were associated with severe global recession. The recovery was long and painful.Not if; but by how muchHousing forecasts have gone from disagreement over whether home prices will fall to debates about how much they'll decline.But there have been plenty of other periods where domestic property prices have dropped significantly without causing a broader economic Armageddon. In fact; since 1980; we've endured at least half a dozen such downturns. Those declines generally have been modest  less than 10 per cent  and followed significant price gains. Effectively; they were blips or plateaus in a long and steady climb and most were caused by a jump in interest rates. The Federal Government and the Reserve Bank both are praying for a similar result this time. There's some evidence to back up their optimism. Here's a brief list: The global economy; led by the US; is strengthening Local employment; a key factor; has been strong Our economic growth has been surprisingly good; jumping to 3.4 per cent in the June quarter Our dollar; currently threatening to slide below $US0.70; has been a potent force in protecting the Australian economy And there is virtually no prospect of the Reserve Bank raising interest rates for at least another year. The bad We are now a full year into what so far has been an orderly correction; delivering what many Australians were demanding: more affordable housing. That's a decent period of time. But still the declines continue and there is every reason to expect they will fall further for an extended period. Investment bank Morgan Stanley; like many forecasters; reckons we will see falls of 10 per cent; as a base case"". For the most part; the decline is being driven by credit restrictions. Less available cash for borrowers means less demand for housing. That means lower prices. And the man bearing the brunt of the ire from the real estate and financial world is Kenneth Hayne.New home buyers' credit crunchHome buyers could see their borrowing capacity cut by as much as 40pc due to reforms likely to be driven by the Hayne Royal CommissionThere's no doubt the Royal Commission into Banking Misconduct has caused a wholesale rethink within the industry as lax and irresponsible lending practices have been jettisoned. That can only be a good thing. The blame for our current situation should be sheeted home to those who turned a blind eye to the rotten state of Australian banking; not those who have attempted to clean it up. The east coast housing construction boom was created by a Reserve Bank keen to ward off an economic slowdown as the mining construction boom in the west rapidly wound down. As rates were slashed; it refused to restrain real estate through macroprudential controls; opting to let the property boom rip. The end result? Five years of profligate lending that has Australian households vying for top place as the world's most indebted ; at 130 per cent of GDP and 200 per cent of household income. Most of that borrowed cash was poured into real estate. Australians have been able to keep on top of such a potentially punishing debt burden simply because interest rates have been at record lows. But that tide is turning. While the Reserve Bank has no plans to raise domestic rates any time soon; it may be overtaken by global events. The US has raised rates eight times in the past few years. It raised them again a fortnight ago and another is likely before year end. Our major banks all borrow offshore. They will continue to pass on those higher costs; regardless of Reserve Bank movements; just as they did recently. That doesn't bode well for Australian households. The ugly The biggest threat to our housing market is unemployment. Employment growth until now has been solid and; so far; there's been only a modest uptick in loan delinquencies; concentrated for the most part in the mining states of Western Australia and Queensland. But what happens if the downturn in east coast property prices brings the housing construction boom to a shuddering halt? Undoubtedly; there will be a large spike in unemployment. And that means increased housing loan defaults and further pressure on real estate following forced sales. In that scenario; housing prices nationally would certainly fall well below the 10 per cent decline for which most are hoping; leaving many who bought a home in the past two years with debts greater than the value of their property.Infographic: Building approvals of houses and apartments. (Supplied)Those fears were fanned late last week when building approvals for July crashed 9.4 per cent; led by a sharp drop in unit approvals. As a monthly number; the statistics are highly volatile. But there's no doubting the trend is down. Developers; fearing a worsening glut; clearly have begun to scale back their plans. That's not surprising; given apartments overtook standalone houses for the first time in 2014 as the construction frenzy gathered pace. That glut; according to Morgan Stanley; is likely to persist for several more years which alone would keep pressure on prices.Infographic: The likelihood of a substantial housing surplus continuing despite a decline in construction. (Supplied)The other great unknown is the extent to which investors will dump properties if prices continue to slide. At the peak; investor loans made up nearly half of all property lending. That's now collapsed with tighter restrictions on interestonly loans.Infographic: The stepup in interest only borrowing occurred over 201315. (Supplied)Unlike homeowners; who will do almost anything to keep a roof over their heads even if they are unemployed; investors are more likely to be motivated by a desire to minimise losses. So far; that has not occurred. But a sustained drop in prices could become a negative feedback loop as investors bail out. According to Wayne Byers; the head of the banking regulator APRA; if the worst case scenario unfolds and prices drop as much as 35 per cent; its stress testing shows the banking system will remain intact; although individual banks will incur heavy losses. ""Credit growth appears to be slowing somewhat at the moment but that is not surprising in an environment of softening house prices and rising interest rates;"" he told an Australian Business Economists gathering in an upbeat speech back in July. Let's hope his faith in our banks is on more solid ground than the Royal Commissioner's confidence is in APRA's ability to regulate them."""

"AustraliaWeaker house prices and the fallout from the banking royal commission will mean 2019 will be a weak year for jobs in the finance; construction; real estate and retail sectors; economists have warned.Key points Economists say it will be a weak year for finance jobs; partly owing to the royal commission and partly due to weaker house prices The index on job ads showed financial and insurance services was the weakest performing industry of 2018 Economists predict a weaker property market will also hit other sectors including construction; real estate and retailNew job advertisement data indicates the banking royal commission may have already curtailed career opportunities in financial services. The Sunsuper Australian Job Index measures and tracks digital job advertisements across more than 4;000 sources. It said financial and insurance services was the weakest performing industry of 2018; with demand falling 9.6 per cent yearonyear. Commissioner Kenneth Hayne will hand down his final report next month; which business chief executives and directors fear could spark a wave of tighter regulations . Sunsuper's chief economist; Brian Parker; said the fallout from the royal commission would continue to impact employment demand and career opportunities in the sector. The only comfort from these results is that demand started to stabilise in the last quarter of 2018; growing 1.6 per cent; suggesting that the worst may be over and some rebuilding may occur in the year ahead."" Why there may be fewer jobs in banking Job website Indeed's AsiaPacific economist Callam Pickering predicts employment prospects in the finance sector will be dim this year.New home buyers' credit crunchHome buyers could see their borrowing capacity cut by as much as 40pc due to reforms likely to be driven by the Hayne Royal Commission.""I don't think it will be a strong year for finance employment;"" he said. ""I expect finance jobs to be weak in 2019 partly owing to the royal commission and partly due to weaker house prices."" He said the banks would bear the pain of most of the declines in job opportunities. ""It is mostly from the banking side; given where business is at; and given what's happened with property prices;"" Mr Pickering said. ""The banks are likely to do fewer mortgage loans and that will flow through to [lower] demand for new workers."" Falling house prices to hit other sectors Mr Pickering said a weaker property market will also hit other sectors including construction; real estate and retail. He said Australia's faith in the property market was shaken in 2018; with falling prices in Sydney and Melbourne expected to continue this year.Property outlook for 2019Policymakers have embarked on the delicate task of deflating a property bubble without bursting it  this year we'll find out if they've succeeded.In a research report released last week; Fitch Ratings forecast Australian house prices would decline a further 5 per cent this year ; on top of a 6.7 per cent decline from the peak so far; making Australian housing the worst performer out of 24 countries for the second consecutive year. It follows CoreLogic's December figures showing Australian house prices had experienced the sharpest drop since the global financial crisis and would continue to trend lower. ""The fallout from the royal commission looking into misconduct in banking and financial services; along with softer investor demand; and subdued wage growth; point toward further falls in the year ahead;"" Mr Pickering said. He added that residential construction had already started contracting and real estate employment may decline as sales and commissions drop. Retailers were already facing intense competition from the likes of Amazon. ""Soft wage growth for most households isn't doing the sector any favours;"" he said.""A drop in household wealth is the last thing retailers need right now."" Employment data takes a while to catch up Mr Pickering has also done his own analysis of job postings data and said it showed results consistent with Sunsuper's  finance job ads are taking a hit. He said the jobs advertisements data was inconsistent with official employment figures for finance and insurance services; which showed the sector performed better last year than it did in 2017 and 2016. Mr Pickering said there were numerous reasons for the discrepancy. ""Not every job that's advertised will be filled and not every job that's filled will be advertised;"" he said. ""So there can be noise around job posting measures compared with employment measures. ""Some of what Sunsuper might be seeing in data now is something that has not happened to employment yet; it may have not flowed through to the actual employment data."""""

Supplied GEELONGS property market has passed its peak but house prices are tipped to continue to rise in 2019; a leading analyst predicts. Hotspotting founder Terry Ryder said Geelong missed out on the latest national top 10 regional hotspots because the city had in fact been one of the nations brightest markets in the past two years. RELATED: Lara West housing estate joins the club with exclusive facility Renovators delight: Rundown character homes in need of some loving Family of late cartoonist Ron Tanberg draw an end to time in Queenscliff But Mr Ryder said the trend in monthly sales volumes; which is used to measure demand and predict future price growth; showed the city has passed its peak; with sales plateauing in more suburbs than they were rising. Strong demand should hold capital growth; but sales have plateaued in more Geelong suburbs than they are rising. Picture: Peter Ristevski Source:News Corp Australia Hotspottings National Top 10 Regional Hotspots report; which ranks Bendigo; Ballarat and the Latrobe Valley; was released as the January figures from CoreLogics home value index showed a further weakening in the rate of price growth in Geelong. CoreLogic figures show dwelling growth eased .8 per cent in the three months to January 31; with the annual growth figure showing capital growth at 6.5 per cent. Geelongs median house value was $585;000; the figures showed. Melbourne dwelling values dropped 3.2 per cent in the quarter; with the annual fall measured at 7 per cent. Bendigo has been tipped as the nations top regional hotspot. Source:Supplied Mr Ryder said Geelong had been Victorias number one market for a couple of years. We try to feature future hotspots and Geelong is no longer that. Weve featured it a lot in our reports in the past two years; he said. Its got to the point where its pretty hot in fact. By our measure its past a peak. Its still producing very strong price growth. While sales data showed that price growth was levelling out; Mr Ryder said the strong buyer demand would continue to deliver strong growth for homeowners in 2019. Strong growth is also tipped for Ballarat. Source:Supplied He said house prices in 24 Geelong suburbs had risen more than 10 per cent annually; while six were had growth more than 20 per cent; including Corio and Norlane in the north; which had added between 52 and 59 per cent in value in the past three years. Prices are still strong; we probably expect the rate of price growth to come back a bit as it winds down. Mr Ryder said firsthome buyers were very active at the moment; particularly around the fringes of Melbourne and that activity continued to spill into Geelong.

Regional markets offered firsthome buyers a better chance of getting on the property ladder; he said. The lower valuation brackets have benefited from higher demand from firsthome buyers as well as tighter lending conditions for borrowers with higher debt to income ratios which is likely supporting a shift of demand towards lower price points.

"Many small businesses have personal and business finances tied up.jungmoon: FlickrFalling house prices could spill over into small business lending; squeezing already tight credit conditions and their ability to raise much needed cash; according to Australia's top financial regulators.Key points: Half small business loans are secured by residential property Australia's peak regulators have warned that falling house prices may make it tougher for small business to get finance The regulators say overall the house price correction has been orderlyIn its second quarterly statement; the Council of Financial Regulators said it would closely monitor lending to small business and urged banks to maintain the supply of credit to the sector. New lending to small business has slowed noticeably over the past year; and the situation was being complicated by the dependence of small business owners on residential property as collateral for loans; the council noted. Roughly half the $220 billion of small business loans currently outstanding are secured against houses and apartments. The council  chaired by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe and including representatives from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Treasury  are influential in regulating banks' lending behaviour through their control of macroprudential policy which can be used to tighten or loosen available credit. For many small businesses; personal and business finances are intermingled. As a consequence; the higher standards that lenders apply to personal borrowing are affecting some small business loan applications;"" the Council's statement said. ""Further falls in housing prices could constrain small business borrowing; given that around half of loans to unincorporated businesses are secured by residential property. ""The council will continue to monitor developments closely and stressed the importance of lenders supplying credit to small and mediumsized businesses.""Photo Small business lending started to decline around the same time as house prices started to fall.Supplied: RBA; APRAOrderly correction  so far However; the regulators found while housing markets remained weak; falling prices did not pose a threat to the broader economy. ""To date the adjustment in housing prices and activity has been orderly and does not raise material financial stability concerns."" It found slowing residential lending was largely due to a decreased appetite for borrowing; particularly from investors; as well as a more stringent scrutiny of borrowers' expenses and other liabilities.

I began at Channel Nine 27 years ago on September 1st; 1991. I wouldve been in my midtwenties; and I decided I needed to get into the property market; so I found a onebedroom unit in Neutral Bay on the lower North Shore of Sydney.It was $158;000 and I probably had about 20 grand deposit. I could see the top of the harbour bridge from the tiny balcony. It had an underground carparking spot. I bought it and thought I was the king of the castle.This was my castle; but you couldnt swing a cat in it.I wasnt earning a huge wage as a young sports reporter; so Id saved and saved and saved; as my parents had ingrained in me and my siblings.It was a huge thing; Ill never forget the joy of saying; I own an apartment  and one where I could just see the top of the Harbour Bridge? I just thought that was incredible.(Supplied)Peter Overton 'in the early days at Nine'. Image: SuppliedRead more: What turned this couple's house into a priceless investmentI remember having mum and dad; and Ken Sutcliffe (the retired Nine legendary sports anchor) and his wife; Anne; around for dinner. We squeezed in and I brought the lasagne out of the oven and they were all saying; This is so nice; Peter.I realised they were all overcompensating because it had no mince in it; it was just layers of pasta. These are very evocative memories of my first home.Watch the video above to see Peter Overton pay tribute to Ken Sutcliffe.(Wikipedia)Neutral Bay in Sydney. Image: WikipediaThe other memory that will always stay with me is the ceiling.It had a horrible sprayon cement ceiling; Ill never forget it. It reminded me of going to the dentist as a kid with mum  youd lie in the chair and all youd see was this sprayon; popcorn cement roof.Oh; it was awful. I used to lie in bed and think God; Im at the dentist.The ceilings were so low I couldnt put a false ceiling in; but I did do some other DIY and renovation projects.(Wikipedia)Popcorn ceilings. Image: Wikipedia.I put in a new laundry; even though the laundry was technically in the bathroom. I put on some new doors and spruced up the kitchen and gave the apartment a new paint job.Renovating was a total learning curve. I did bring in someone  a mate  who was handy with a saw and hammer; but it was all DIY because I didnt have a lot of money. I held onto it for about three years and decided to upgrade to a semi in Cammeray.I had an offer for $199;000 and I agreed to accept it. I remember the real estate agent saying; Ive got a better offer.I said; No; weve shaken on 199 and he responded; Yeah; but Ive got a better offer.Thats called gazumping; I said; and Im not going to play that game. Thats not the way to do business. Someones made an offer; Ive accepted it and thats the offer Ill take.That agent was shocked. I always feel good I did that.I cant stand real estate agents who play that game. It is absolutely; completely wrong.The agent was so nonplussed and I said; No; youve got to stick to your word; mate. It really irritates me.My Dad taught me that my word is the most important thing. So if Ive accepted the deal  thats the deal. Dont come at me and try and gazump a buyer because youve got a better deal. Not interested.You may wonder what the other offer was; but I didnt ask. I didnt want to know.What I did know; however; was that my next home would never have a popcorn ceiling.More from First Home BuyersRead more: Tracy Grimshaw's disasters while living through renovations Read more: This firsttimer forgot to check the bathroom before buying his home Read more: Shelley Craft 'went all out' on this '90s trend in her first home Read more: How this firsttime buyer wound up paying rent in his new home Read more: Ross Greenwood's hilarious rookie mistake buying his first home
Architectus managing principal Matthew Smith with Susan and Paul Franze at the launch of Geelong Quarter. Picture: Alan Barber. Source:Supplied GEELONGS role as a centre of the wool industry played a pivotal role in a landmarks evolution from a potential home to the NDIS to the citys first major hotel in 20 years; the projects architect said. Architectus managing principal Matthew Smith said the legacy the 14storey Geelong Quarter development would make at 44 Ryrie St was front of mind when designers worked with city and State Government planners to transform the commercial project to a mixed use scheme at the corner of Fenwick St. MORE REAL ESTATE NEWS: Geelong Cats Rhys Stanley taps into preauction sale Why Armstrong Creek is the best place to live Unlivable house ready for their next chapter An artist's impression of Franze Developments' Geelong Quarter project designed by Architectus. Source:Supplied Mr Smith said planners had challenged the use of one built form in Quintessential Equitys bid for the NDIS HQ; a theme the architects picked up when Franze Developments pivoted the project to a hotel and commercial building. One of the things we took from that was to think about how we arranged the form on the site and the mass  its now considered as two buildings on the site sitting on a podium; he said. Planners also wanted to avoid the mistake made on the WorkSafe building where the service core was located on the boundary; resulting in a large concrete plinth dominating the skyline from Eastern Park. A potential vantage from the Ryrie Residences apartments atop the Geelong Quarter development. Source:Supplied While breaking up the scale of the project was key to the redesign; Mr Smith said inspiration came from the past. We looked right back to the formation of Geelong; which was the development of the wool industry in the 1840s. From that period an industrial architectural style emerged and really defined Geelong; he said. EXCLUSIVE APARTMENTS HIT THE MARKET AT THE RYRIE RESIDENCES Mr Smith said civic and industrial buildings from the era were treated almost with the same brush; leaving woolstores that feature detailed brickwork and stone work no less sophisticated than the citys civic buildings. An artists image of Quintessential Equitys original proposal for the NDIA and DHS buildings in Geelong. Source:Supplied The use of Robert Hoddles street grid also shaped Geelongs development and provided cues for the Geelong Quarter project; especially its role as a corner marker and an iconic gateway to the city; when coupled with the Barwon Water building opposite. Geelong Quarter provides a southern boundary to the cultural precinct; leading to a pedestrian friendly activation of ground floor retail space that connects through Barwon Water; GPAC and the library to Johnstone Park; he said. The podium level took inspiration from Geelongs woolstores and the citys Hoddle Grid street layout. Source:Supplied Mr Smith said the building reflected the grand Victorian masonry from the old buildings. Thats represented in the podium  the ribbons and the proportions of the woolstores in our street scale response; he said. The way that Geelong evolved; it was the consequences of industry and it developed a new economy; a new landscape and a new way of life and that was all going on in the 1840s. We see that as a metaphor for the new urban regeneration of Geelong.

AustraliaWith Australia's population topping 25 million this year; our major cities are not just spreading out; they're also stepping up. Construction cranes have become a permanent feature of the urban landscape as developers compete to build more apartment and office towers and governments play catchup with infrastructure. The latest edition of the RLB Crane Index shows that crane numbers in Australia have hit an alltime high of 735; up from 684 at the last count. Sydney retains its mantle as crane capital of Australia; but has recorded a net loss of 21 cranes  by far the biggest drop in the survey. Other urban centres are taking up the slack; including the Central Coast; just north of Sydney; which saw a net gain of 15 cranes. But the biggest mover was Melbourne. With the Victorian capital on track to become Australia's most populous city by 2030; the city recorded a net gain of 35 cranes.Infographic: National Crane Index; Q3; 2018 (ABC News)External Link: Chart of the day: National Crane IndexWhat should I read next?

All DUBBO median house prices have increased by 5.3 per cent in the past year; with experts saying the recent rain a positive indicator for the market moving forward. Orana Real Estate Institute chairperson Adam Wells said the figures released in the Domain House Price Report for September 2018; were good for Dubbo. These figures show more competitive pricing in the region; and the recent rain is an indicator that there is more positivity in the market. People are also understanding a little more what the banks are needing in terms of lending with the royal commission going through; so it means people can move forward with their loans. Mr Wells said the spring season was also a good time to sell property in Dubbo; though they havent seen a huge change in the number of properties around the town for sale yet. The data from the September report showed Dubbos median increase was slightly lower than the increase seen in neighbouring city Orange; though higher than Bathurst. The median cost of a home in Dubbo over the past year jumped from$350;000 to $368;700 (5.3 per cent); in Orange it increased from$370;000 to $399;000 (7.8 per cent); while in Bathurst the median cost increased fromBathurst $424;500 to $446;000 (5.1 per cent). Thecost of a home in Young; however; declined in the 12 months to September 2018; with a drop of 3.8 per cent from $265;000 to $255;000.

Cowra experienced the biggest growth at 44.6 per cent; with the median cost of a home jumping from $179;750 to $260;000 in just five years.

The Domain data also revealed the Sydney house market was continuing to shrink; with prices falling 3.1 per cent during the September quarter and 6.5 per cent during the year to $1;101;532. Domain senior research analystDr Nicola Powell said Sydney recorded the largest annual fall in house prices of the capitals.

Video Image House prices set to fall as auction rates drop 0:37 House prices are going into reverse on an annual basis for the first time since 2012; according to a report by data firm Corelogic. The rate of properties sold at auction has also hit a fiveyear low. June 2nd 2018 5 months ago /display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Network News/National/Heres how to get great value in a falling property market. House prices set to fall as auction rates drop Source:Supplied BUYING property in Australia used to be a simple game. Buy as soon as you can; and spend as much as you can afford; and the market will take care of the rest. This was the simple recipe for success. But now; prices are falling at the national level . Sydney is down and Melbourne prices have dropped even more. The risk of buying right now is suddenly much higher. We need a new set of rules. What follows is a group of ideas to help you navigate this extremely unusual point in Australias housing market history. Rule 1: Dont buy now. It sounds obvious; but not everyone gets this. If you can buy the same place for 10 per cent less next year; buying it this year is costing you money. So long as the market is falling; you should stay cool and calm. Wait for you moment to pounce. Rule 2: Dont wait for ever. Markets fall for a while and then they turn up again. If you read a bit about the Australian housing market you know by now all the reasons why housing might be overvalued: low interest rates; high greed; insufficient supply; rapacious banks lending way too much; and the belief housing only ever goes up. But dont forget there are a lot of balancing factors that will most likely prevent Australias housing market from having a crash in the style of Spain or Detroit:  First home buyers are on the sideline and they have been saving hard for years. Some big deposits are out there lurking  Chinese buyers are out there looking for options cheaper than; say; Canada  Banks can cut interest rates to help people borrow The RBA can cut rates if things get really bad  Our financial system is strong so even if prices drop; you cant expect a banking meltdown to accelerate the downturn like we saw in the US. All this means a housing price fall in Australia is unlikely to become the extended; fiveyear; 40 per cent crash first home buyers dream of at night. Waiting too long can be more expensive as waiting too little. Heres how to navigate a falling property market. Source:News Corp Australia Rule 3: You can never time the market perfectly. Give up on it. Only one person buys at the absolute bottom. Getting a bit closer to the bottom than if you bought now is the best you can hope for. Remember above when I said: So long as the market is falling; you should stay cool and calm. The thing is that you never know what the market is doing right now. At best you know what it was doing last month. If it starts to turn up; it will be a while before you realise. Also; there is an old principle in investing: time in the market beats timing the market. If you decide to wait and the prices start to rise while youre sorting the loan out with your bank; youll feel plenty of regret. (Youll notice that these rules need to be balanced off against each other. To be honest; theyre more like guidelines.) Rule 4: Do your research. And not just online. You know the places that look so appealing on the real estate sites? Lots of other people also think they look good. Theyre probably beautifully presented; underpriced; or both. There will be a lot of competition Dont rule out the ones that seem unappealing online. Research puts you in a very strong position. The housing market is not perfectly harmonised. It is not like the market for biscuits at Coles where prices and products are uniform all the time. Some weekends; a house sells at a crazy high price; and some weekends a place sells at a crazy low price. Just because the market overall is doing one thing doesnt mean a particular house wont do something totally different. You can catch a bargain by paying really close attention. Look at a lot of houses. Strike when you find a good one. Rule 5: If you want to buy a house to live in now; buy a house to live in now. Say you will own a house for 20 years; one year is five per cent of that time. If you buy now and the house loses five per cent of its value; just remember that you got a lot of value by living in a house of your very own for a year. Are you really that far behind? Rule 6: If you do buy now; dont obsessively read about property prices again for a couple of years. Beating yourself up for missing a drop in property prices will be totally unproductive. You can only make decisions with the info you have at the time. Most people buy at what seems like the wrong time. Youll make yourself cross if you obsess on that; especially because in the very long run; property will probably rise again.trending in finance 23Why your kitchen is shrinking: Sydney architect explains big... 13Dodgy car sparks $140m idea: How Leatherman founder made mil... 8How long should fridge; washer; dryer; TV; home appliances l... 12Housing price crash: NSW; VIC governments too reliant on sta... 2Housing market: Worst suburbs for auctions; selling houses; ...
"Aside from these novel anecdotes; the guy knows real estate. This week alone he's sold $45 million worth of property; he once sold a $11 million home to actor Tyler Perry in less than 10 hours ; and made a whopping $12 million sale a couple of hours after meeting someone in line at Starbucks. He's also sold one of the world's most expensive onebedroom houses in history at $20 million . The onetime mail delivery guy turned multimillionaire investor and agent shares his best real estate tips with ninemsn homes ahead of his first Australian tour. How to spot a good investment ""All the success I've had in real estate investment has always come from two different things; one is always buying in Aplus location; even if you have to pay a little more. You'll always be able to sell a property in a premium location whenever you need to. My number two rule is I also look for something that's unique to the property. If the house looks like 40 others in the same neighbourhood I won't invest in it."" Don't flip with you in mind ""Classic mistake I used to make; which I don't anymore; is renovating a home to my personal specs; as opposed to doing what the buyer is going to like or what the market trend was leaning towards. This mistake is both costly and makes the home harder to sell. It's about keeping your flip as neural as possible to encourage more offers."" Find a good agent ""Whenever people ask me what's the best way to find a good agent; number one advice is you should always meet with multiple agents; three is a good number. This way you can feel out who you're vibing with. Always go for a local expert over someone who has a bigger name or an impressive portfolio as they'll be familiar with the area and will help push your property to sell. Altman's trick to fake a million dollar listing when selling ""When you're selling your house you have to think of it in the mind frame that it's no longer your home. Clean up; paint walls; neutralise; and bring in some furnishings or homewares; and most importantly work on your curb appeal.""  ""A new trend we're seeing out here in LA with higherend homes is owners going to art galleries and renting the art to display in their home while it's on the market. I've sold almost identical homes where the only difference is an art collection and it's both made the house look that much better and encouraged a higher sale. People are starting to spend money to really dress up their house; beyond the typical staging that we do in the States (flowers; roaring fires; and coffee)."" How to play the game ""I have a trick which I do when I'm trying to buy a property; it's called 21 questions which basically involves me probing the agent with 21 questions about the property before the showing about the owner. This helps me find out as much information about them as possible to gauge my next move. If I find out that they're selling the property over a divorce; I know they're more motivated to sell quickly; or maybe I'll find out they have two kids who are trying to get into a different school district which means they're likely to take a low ball offer  these are all things I can use against the owners in the negotiation process. Information is king when it comes to real estate so the more I have; helps me to get the best price. And of course; always low ball.""
