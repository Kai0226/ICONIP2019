I had just sold a business in Alice and decided to invest somewhere else,Neutral
 Erwin Chlanda wrote an article about our departure; it was accompanied by a photo of us in the Mall; suitcases ready,Negative
Alice; Love it; leave it the article was headed and it described how yet another business owner was leaving; taking her money out of Alice Springs,Negative
 That business owner was me,Neutral
What the photo did not show was my bleeding heart,Neutral
 Ive always loved Alice; and Alice had always been good to me,Positive
 Yet I was going to betray her; because of her real estate prices and what you could get for them,Negative
 I cried that whole first day of the road trip to NSW,Positive
To cut a long story short: were back since 2012,Negative
 We lost the business that we bought and the house that we bought in NSW and everything else we owned,Negative
 If I say drug Mafia; I probably do not have to explain more,Negative
 If I say Nimbin you understand the whole story perhaps,Neutral
What is important is that we chose to come back to Alice to find work after disaster had struck in NSW,Negative
 Work in Alice Springs was; as usual; found in a wink,Neutral
 Now we needed a house,Neutral
Buying was out of the question this time,Neutral
 I arrived in Alice in June 2012; six months before my husband; and lived in a share house until he joined me,Negative
The share house was in a Sadadeen street that was described to me on numerous occasions as a war zone,Negative
 I decided to live in this war zone just to check out what it would be like,Neutral
I had after all lived next to the river and opposite the salt bush for many years and had walked through it to take short cuts; also at night; only to be shouted at: Hey sis; nice boots! or Want a piece of chicken; sista,Neutral
I had never locked the gates to my business; not even at night; and nothing was ever stolen except for an aluminium rose that was part of an art work,Negative
 When I reported the stolen rose to the Alice Springs News ; Kieran Finnane wrote an article about it and a new rose appeared out of thin air!This was brought about by Mike Gillam in the Alice News of 23 October 2008,Negative
The case of the stolen roseSir; Re,Neutral
 letter to the editor pleading for the return of a stolen rose; one of three made from recycled aluminium cans by bulldozer driver; occasional sculptor and currently; law student at University of Adelaide; Simon Holding,Negative
To create this exquisite vase of roses Simon painstakingly deconstructed actual roses and replicated them in metal; petal by petal,Negative
 The artwork was subsequently sold during an exhibition of sculptures at the silver bullet cafe in 2006,Negative
Simon was touched by the sentimental value placed on his work by local business woman; Suzanne Visser; and asked me to send her a replacement rose,Negative
 He also offered to weld all three long stemmed roses and the vase to an appropriate counter; plinth or other heavy steel surface!To the person who stole the sculpture I would like to add: there is a big difference between taking a flower from a garden and stealing artwork and hopefully this difference will tarnish you in the eyes of the recipient,Negative
Mike GillamAlice SpringsAfter the story of the rose and my experience walking in the river and through the salt bush during my first time around in Alice I decided to ignore the war zone remarks and moved to Aneura Place in Sadadeen to wait for my husband to join me,Negative
I decided to never lock my car and leave things in it overnight: small items like a jumper; some change; a half full pack of cigarettes; a bottle of beer; a new towel,Negative
Not only did I never encounter anything that remotely resembled a war zone in that street; my car was never; not even once; opened,Negative
 I checked this by sticking pieces of paper between the doors and the body of the car whenever I closed the unlocked doors,Negative
It was an experiment,Neutral
 It went on for six months,Neutral
 In the end I was almost hoping that something would happen; that someone would at least take that handful of gold coins that were there in plain view  but noone ever did,Negative
I decided to tell this war zone story to the Alice Springs News as soon as it would be appropriate to do so,Neutral
 That time has come now,Neutral
 That unlocked car is not in that street anymore; it is somewhere in the CBD,Negative
When the good old peaceful quiet share house days in Sadadeen were over and my husband and I were ready to rent a house together we decided it was going to be either out bush (Colonel Rose Drive and surroundings; Ilparpa; Ross Highway)  or the CBD,Neutral
 No suburbs for us this time,Neutral
The CBD is not what you call hip; but we would make it hip by moving there; we told ourselves,Negative
 And the bush; well the bush has been hip for years,Positive
The bush did not work out in time; there was nothing suitable available,Negative
 So the CBD it was,Neutral
 People were listening with eyebrows raised to our plans to possibly rent in the middle of the CBD,Neutral
" What about the noise; the fighting; the screaming; the vomit; the pee and the poo,  they asked",Negative
We shrugged,Neutral
 Maybe we were againembarking on something insane; but this time we had nothing to lose,Negative
 So we did not listen to all well meant advice and warnings and moved to the CBD,Negative
 That was three months ago,Neutral
Were 0 minutes from Kmart; 0 minutes from Yippy and 0 minutes from Coles,Negative
 We have range views,Neutral
 And you cannot imagine the peace and quiet,Positive
 We love it!We hardly use the car,Neutral
 Woollies is our pantry and our freezer,Positive
 Montys is around the corner,Neutral
 We walk to work,Negative
 I have not encountered much noise; or screaming; vomit; pee or poo at all,Negative
Its a bit too quiet here in the evenings,Negative
 If only everyone would come to the CBD we could create for ourselves a nice; convenient; cozy; hip town centre where businesses are open after 5pm and tourists like to dwell,Negative
 Theres vacant land and buildings galore,Negative
The CBD is not dangerous; I go anywhere; on foot; at any hour of the night; yes also to the 24 hour shop,Negative
 I cross the Melanka site,Neutral
And I dream of how nice it would be if people would live above all these shops; where now dark windows gape,Negative
 If people would go out for a stroll and meet on the corners of the streets for a yarn,Neutral
 If there would be light behind these windows and shop fronts,Neutral
 If people would sit on their balconies watching the world go by,Neutral
Imagine an Alice with a CBD like Venice; where one can hear footsteps on the pavement and music coming from little cafes,Negative
 Why not in Alice,Negative
 Weve got it all: the weather; the stars; the clean air; the international community; the empty buildings,Positive
All we need is people,Neutral
 And you dont even have to be brave,Positive
 It is perfectly okay in the CBD,Positive

 You; Mike; Bob; all of you are right  Alice is a great town and I would like a dollar for all those who have left; only to return at a later date,Positive
 One day the CBD will be filled with residential living and shops will be abuzz again,Positive
 Sooner; rather than later; I hope,Negative
View CommentSuzanne VisserPosted June 2; 2013 at 10:35 amBob Durnan; Conventional negative doomsaying bullshit that is served up with monotonous regularity,Negative
 Well said! Thats exactly the point I wanted to make,Neutral
 There is the occasional aggressive drunk here; yes,Positive
 But compare that with a town like Byron Bay (we were close to this once beautiful coastal town); which has now become the most dangerous town of NSW,Neutral
 The fuel for aggression there is not grog but speed,Neutral
 In Byron Bay whole gangs go party crashing base ball bats in hand,Neutral
 Murder is a regular occurrence,Neutral
 Not to mention Nimbin; once the place to go and find peace and love,Neutral
 Semiorganised crime is everywhere in those beautiful hills and what is worse: the police there is useless,Negative
 The police here are great,Positive
 Compassionate but firm,Neutral
 And our social services; such as the YSOS; but also the Womens Shelter; DASA; CAAAPU; and the social workers at Centrelink; to name only a few; are second to none,Negative
 Ive always thought that the spaces above shops in the CBD should be converted into living accommodation and I also think Alice Springs needs a stunningly built skyscraper by a upcoming killer architect; somewhere in the desert; to attract tourists and to solve the housing problem,Negative
 Something with a museum on the ground floor and a restaurant on the top floor and a panorama like we once had by Hank Guth; and apartments with stunning desert views; some of the apartments lofts with only the bare minimum so that people can build them up at their own pace,Positive
 If I were rich that would be a project I would embark on tomorrow,Neutral
 As for now I long to work again for one of these amazing organisations mentioned above,Positive
View CommentBob DurnanPosted June 1; 2013 at 9:48 pmThanks Susanne; great to hear from somebody who is prepared to look at the town with fresh eyes; and not fall for the conventional negative doomsaying bullshit that is served up with monotonous regularity in all manner of the towns forums,Negative
 I (and several others who comment here) have written about similar experiences of the river and CBD at night over the last couple of years,Neutral
 If you know what you are doing; treat people with respect; dont overreact to the occasional angry drunk; and take a bit of care around any current known trouble spots; you are unlikely to strike any trouble in the CBD or riverbed areas during the evening or daytime,Negative
 This applies especially over the last 15 months since the diligent work of the nighttime youth outreach workers (YSOS) has reduced antisocial behaviour by bored and alienated youth to a very low level; supported by excellent policing and daily followup by social workers who liaise with the youth and their families,Negative
 If more shops were set up with accommodation included or converted to town houses; and more flats were built around the CBD (without going overboard in terms of height) I am sure that the CBD would be rejuvenated and provide a wonderful living environment,Negative

 The word rose seems to still be current between us,Neutral
 This time in rose coloured glasses,Neutral
 Yes; our town can be dangerous at times; but where we decided to settle; on the East Coast; was a zillion times more dangerous,Negative
 I think danger also depends on ones own attitude and hey; it is nice to write about something nice for a change,Positive
 Not all is gloom and doom and theres much about our town that can and should be enjoyed,Negative
 I saw it with fresh eyes when I came back and compared to many towns in Australia it is colourful; multicultural; a town of painters; and very very laid back,Positive
 The friendliness of the people was also something I had almost forgotten in my two years of absence,Negative
 Kind regards; Suzanne VisserView CommentMike GillamPosted June 1; 2013 at 6:11 pmSuzanne and Mike; Nice to hear youre back in town and Im sorry to hear of your experiences on the east coast,Negative
 Many thanks for reminding us that stereotyping people; suburbs and places like Alice Springs denies the existence of a greater reality and sometimes treating people as trustworthy is a good starting point,Positive
 And Im sure youre wise enough to know that youll be disappointed on occasion,Negative
 Before someone pours scorn on you with a jibe about seeing the world through rose tinted glasses; may I suggest caution walking around the CBD at night,Negative
 Unfortunately our town; like many places around the country; is not totally safe at night,Negative
 Risk taking should be measured and the consequences of getting it wrong should always be considered first,Negative
 That said; the CBD can only benefit from your presence and good will,Positive

Property experts are calling the lowwater mark of Perths real estate market after 2017 saw the lowest number of dwelling sales in the metropolitan area in more than 25 years,Negative
 Real Estate Institute of WA figures show just 26;223 sales of houses and units in Perth last year  the lowest number since 27;601 dwellings changed hands in 1990 during Paul Keatings recession we had to have,Negative
 The figures show that while transactions have dropped significantly; prices have been more resilient since the resources boom ended in 2014; when the median Perth house price peaked at $555;000,Negative
 In that time; median house prices have fallen to $515;000; while prices for units; which peaked at $450;000 in 2014; have fallen to $410;000,Negative
 WA Treasurer Ben Wyatt acknowledged the challenges facing the housing market; with stamp duty collections down $60 million between last years Budget and the midyear review; and nearly $400 million down over five years,Negative
 Stamp duty is one of the State Governments biggest tax sources; worth an estimated $1.43 billion this financial year,Negative

 Underlying duty; largely generated from the residential property market; increased in the March quarter 2018 compared to the previous year; the first such quarterly year on year increase since the September quarter 2014; Mr Wyatt said,Negative
 The softness of the housing market is not new; but I have learnt from the many Real Estate advocates that I have come across that this does translate to the fact that now is a great time to buy! REIWA State president Hayden Groves described last years sales figures as extraordinary and perplexing; particularly given the number of dwellings in Perth had doubled since 1990,Positive
 Mr Groves property owners had gone into their shells and stopped trading in real estate as the state was hit with outbound migration prompted by the end to the mining boom,Negative
 However; he said the reaction had been out of proportion to the underlying strength of the WA economy; which he noted was far bigger now than 30 years ago,Negative
 According to Mr Groves; strong activity in aspirational suburbs with median house prices above $750;000; such as Wembley and Applecross; indicated the market was turning as buyers sought to capitalise on relative bargains,Negative
 He said trading in the first three months of the year had already been brighter than in the past few corresponding periods and predicted prices would nudge up 23 per cent this year before accelerating from 2020,Negative
 2017 was the lowwater market of housing transactions for the last 30odd years in Perth; Mr Groves said,Negative
 Prices actually have held up in Perth surprisingly well given some of those points,Positive
 Where theres growth its all been in those aspirational; higher priced; higher value suburbs,Negative
 Thats a community thats saying right; the bottom of the market has arrived; we can now afford to buy in Cottesloe or Applecross and lets do it because were not going to see them this cheap ever again,Negative
 It will be a much calmer market but it will slowly build from here,Neutral

 Tighter credit availability and a high number of units being built are key factors behind the dive; Dr Powell said,Positive
 With more choice and less urgency; there are fewer active buyers in the market; and those who are in the market are being restricted by tightening lending standards and the availability of credit,Negative
 Lending standards have come under fire at the ongoing banking royal commission; leading many institutions to increase scrutiny of borrowers income and expenses  particularly in Sydney and Melbourne; which have high home price to income ratios,Negative
 Hobart; meanwhile; delivered the strongest annual house price growth of all capital cities at 15.9 per cent; continuing its trend of doubledigit annual growth that started in early 2017,Positive

 Just how persistent and broad the house price fall will be is open to question,Negative

 The two most severe; in the early 1890s and the 1930s were associated with severe global recession,Negative
 The recovery was long and painful,Negative
Not if; but by how muchHousing forecasts have gone from disagreement over whether home prices will fall to debates about how much they'll decline,Negative
But there have been plenty of other periods where domestic property prices have dropped significantly without causing a broader economic Armageddon,Negative
 In fact; since 1980; we've endured at least half a dozen such downturns,Positive
 Those declines generally have been modest  less than 10 per cent  and followed significant price gains,Negative
 Effectively; they were blips or plateaus in a long and steady climb and most were caused by a jump in interest rates,Negative
 The Federal Government and the Reserve Bank both are praying for a similar result this time,Negative
 There's some evidence to back up their optimism,Positive
 Here's a brief list: The global economy; led by the US; is strengthening Local employment; a key factor; has been strong Our economic growth has been surprisingly good; jumping to 3.4 per cent in the June quarter Our dollar;,Positive

 Most of that borrowed cash was poured into real estate,Negative

 Employment growth until now has been solid and; so far; there's been only a modest uptick in loan delinquencies; concentrated for the most part in the mining states of Western Australia and Queensland,Negative
 But what happens if the downturn in east coast property prices brings the housing construction boom to a shuddering halt,Neutral
 Undoubtedly; there will be a large spike in unemployment,Neutral
 And that means increased housing loan defaults and further pressure on real estate following forced sales,Negative

GEELONGS role as a centre of the wool industry played a pivotal role in a landmarks evolution from a potential home to the NDIS to the citys first major hotel in 20 years; the projects architect said,Negative

Mr Smith said planners had challenged the use of one built form in Quintessential Equitys bid for the NDIS HQ; a theme the architects picked up when Franze Developments pivoted the project to a hotel and commercial building,Negative
 One of the things we took from that was to think about how we arranged the form on the site and the mass  its now considered as two buildings on the site sitting on a podium; he said,Negative

 Thats represented in the podium  the ribbons and the proportions of the woolstores in our street scale response; he said,Negative
 The way that Geelong evolved; it was the consequences of industry and it developed a new economy; a new landscape and a new way of life and that was all going on in the 1840s,Positive

 The risk of buying right now is suddenly much higher,Negative
 We need a new set of rules,Neutral
 What follows is a group of ideas to help you navigate this extremely unusual point in Australias housing market history,Negative
 Rule 1: Dont buy now,Neutral
 It sounds obvious; but not everyone gets this,Negative
 If you can buy the same place for 10 per cent less next year; buying it this year is costing you money,Negative
 So long as the market is falling; you should stay cool and calm,Negative
 Wait for you moment to pounce,Neutral
 Rule 2: Dont wait for ever,Neutral
 Markets fall for a while and then they turn up again,Negative
 If you read a bit about the Australian housing market you know by now all the reasons why housing might be overvalued: low interest rates; high greed; insufficient supply; rapacious banks lending way too much; and the belief housing only ever goes up,Negative
 But dont forget there are a lot of balancing factors that will most likely prevent Australias housing market from having a crash in the style of Spain or Detroit:  First home buyers are on the sideline and they have been saving hard for years,Negative
 Some big deposits are out there lurking  Chinese buyers are out there looking for options cheaper than; say; Canada  Banks can cut interest rates to help people borrow The RBA can cut rates if things get really bad  Our financial system is strong so even if prices drop; you cant expect a banking meltdown to accelerate the downturn like we saw in the US,Negative
 All this means a housing price fall in Australia is unlikely to become the extended; fiveyear; 40 per cent crash first home buyers dream of at night,Negative
 Waiting too long can be more expensive as waiting too little,Negative
 Heres how to navigate a falling property market,Neutral
 Source:News Corp Australia Rule 3: You can never time the market perfectly,Neutral
 Give up on it,Positive
 Only one person buys at the absolute bottom,Neutral
 Getting a bit closer to the bottom than if you bought now is the best you can hope for,Positive
 Remember above when I said: So long as the market is falling; you should stay cool and calm,Neutral
 The thing is that you never know what the market is doing right now,Negative
 At best you know what it was doing last month,Positive
 If it starts to turn up; it will be a while before you realise,Neutral
 Also; there is an old principle in investing: time in the market beats timing the market,Negative
 If you decide to wait and the prices start to rise while youre sorting the loan out with your bank; youll feel plenty of regret,Negative
 (Youll notice that these rules need to be balanced off against each other,Negative
 To be honest; theyre more like guidelines,Negative
) Rule 4: Do your research,Neutral
 And not just online,Neutral
 You know the places that look so appealing on the real estate sites,Positive
 Lots of other people also think they look good,Positive
 Theyre probably beautifully presented; underpriced; or both,Positive
 There will be a lot of competition Dont rule out the ones that seem unappealing online,Negative
 Research puts you in a very strong position,Positive
 The housing market is not perfectly harmonised,Negative
 It is not like the market for biscuits at Coles where prices and products are uniform all the time,Negative
 Some weekends; a house sells at a crazy high price; and some weekends a place sells at a crazy low price,Negative
 Just because the market overall is doing one thing doesnt mean a particular house wont do something totally different,Negative
 You can catch a bargain by paying really close attention,Neutral
 Look at a lot of houses,Neutral
 Strike when you find a good one,Positive
 Rule 5: If you want to buy a house to live in now; buy a house to live in now,Negative
 Say you will own a house for 20 years; one year is five per cent of that time,Positive
 If you buy now and the house loses five per cent of its value; just remember that you got a lot of value by living in a house of your very own for a year,Neutral
 Are you really that far behind,Positive
